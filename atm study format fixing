A. Introduction

In the field of Interaction design, in involves four basic process mainly known as the Identifying needs and establishing 
requirements, developing alternative designs, building the interactive version of the design and the last process which 
is evaluating. These four activities of Interaction design serves as the frame or skeleton in the case study, it provides
the criteria for us to evaluate the over-all design of the machine. Every machine must undergo these processes to identify
and meet the specific task is should perform. Having knowledge of what Interaction Design is provides ease on how to 
evaluate the Product on this Case Study. It will also allow us formulate questions such as does it meet the requirements
given or what are the possible improvements for this design. This serves as the guide not only to have the knowledge to
criticize but also the ability to see the improvement and build alternative design for the product. In simple word the
Interaction design help to identify the machine our case study if it is properly planned.


B. The process of Interaction Design




1. Identifying needs and establishing requirements for the user experience (Establishing Requirements)

       Users: Who are they?
       -The ATM machine possess a simple design making it very easy to operate, it does not require users to have  a 
       high level mastery in computers to perform a particular task, every buttons are displayed with labels that are 
       precise with the functions it offers, every instructions are provided to every page, such as what to enter, what
       category to select and what are the  transactions that are done, it only requires the user to read and follow
       every step carefully to accomplish a task, every user has the capacity to learn even those who has no experience
       with computers, it only requires a correct understanding of the flow of instructions.

       Users: Who are they?
       The machine is very learnable because it has directions to fit every user. It has voice instructions for users
       with strong auditory senses and uses arrows for people with visual strengths. Users must have knowledge on basic
       mathematical operations such as addition and subtraction for them to know how much money they will withdraw, or 
       in some cases, deposit. The machine is very straightforward and direct on the transactions that should be made. 
       Any user that has the capability to read well the instructions will not find a hard time operating the machine.

       Users: Who are they?
       -As mentioned in the positive personal experiences list, a beginner computer user with almost zero knowledge 
       about intermidiate computer functions can access the ATM’s, as long as they know how to read instructions, press
       the buttons, and they should be knowledgeable about the basic banking transactions offered by their banks through
       ATM’s. Of course they should be bringing the debit cards with them when accessing the machine as it’s the most 
       important item.

        Balance Inquiry:

       1.  Push the button beside “balance inquiry” (pointed by red arrow). It should bring you to PICTURE 2.
       2. Choose the kind of balance you want to check. It should lead you to PICTURE 3.

       Deposit:

       1. Pick “Transfers” (shown by the blue arrow).
       2. Select Transferee Bank.
       3. Enter the account number of the account you wish to transfer funds to. Afterwards, it would lead you to the same window as shown in PICTURE 2.
       4. Select type of bank account to be used.
       5. The window in PICTURE 4 should appear. Type and confirm the desired amount.

       Withdraw:

       1. Pick “Withdraw Cash” (shown by the violet arrow). 
       2.Choose where to withdraw from the list shown in PICTURE 2.
       3. Type and confirm the desired amount in the input box shown in PICTURE 4.


       C. User Experience
       
       Positive
       1.The interface design is simple and easy to operate, proper labels and appropriate lights are placed where it is needed to allow the users locate it easily
       2.When it comes to safety, it assures that the users privacy is secured by placing covers to the pad and implementing the process of encryption
       3.Multiple functions are provided allowing the user have  a greater control, it is vey useful especially in case of emergencies
       4.Graphics that are implemented is not harmful to the eye, it is simple and colors used is appropriate
       
       Negative
       1.It lacks constraints such as limitation of entering an amount divisible by 100, this can cause errors to the user by entering a wrong amount.
       2.The locations of the machine is crowded that reduces the safety of the user, this type of environment can be annoying to some users
       3.Some buttons are not functioning well, it does not response with the user even it is clicked.
       4.The screen display has a black area which affects the labels of the buttons, this can really be distracting and might cause disturbance when using the machine

	Positive
       1.Has a female voice-over to guide you and instruct you.
       2.Lights are not disturbing and has a security camera.
       3.The keypad has cover over your hands to hide your pin when entering it.
       4.Has arrows to direct you to the button which you should press. It also has light guiding for you to know what is coming out of the machine. (e.g. Receipt, ATM card)
      
       Negative
       1.Does not have confirmations before every transaction.
       2.It is not consistent with other machines in the entering of the pin. (Some machines require you to press enter after you typed your pin)
       3.The receipt is sometimes slow in coming out. Some users will tend to forget to get theirs.
       4.If the machine does not have money, it does not inform the user in the withdraw option until the entry of amount.

       Positive
       -Machines function fast  enough not to hinder the users.
       -The lightings are fine, although the opinion might differ when tried out during the night.
       -The instructions are easy to follow
       - Basic functionalities could be easily done and accessed by beginner computer users.
       
       Negative
       -The areas of the ATM’s are all too public for safety usage. The ATM’s are also poorly guarded.
       -The numeric keypads are obviously not well-maintained. (Full of rusts and some other slight defects)
       -Color combinations aren’t good for the eyes (ie. Sterling bank’s color scheme orange-blue hurts the eyes  ) 
       -This one’s more of a matter of opinion, but there are times when the contents of the ATM window occupies a lot less space when compared with the unused portions of the window. Those spaces could have been used more efficiently probably through making the texts look bigger and more centralized.
